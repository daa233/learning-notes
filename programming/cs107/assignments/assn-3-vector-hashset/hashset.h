 * be returned every single time the same element (where same is defined
 * in the HashSetCompareFunction sense) is hashed.  Ideally, the
 * hash routine would manage to distribute the spectrum of client elements

 * Type: HashSetCompareFunction
 * ----------------------------
 * Class of function designed to compare two elements, each identified

 * decides whether or not they are logically equal or or.  The
 * return value identifies relative ordering:
 * 
 *   - A negative return value means that the item addressed by elemAddr1
 *     is less than the item addressed by elemAddr2.  The definition of
 *     'less than' is dictated by the implementation's interpretation of the data.
 *   - A zero return value means that the two items addressed by elemAddr1
 *     and elemAddr2 are equal as far as the comparison routine is concerned.
 *   - A positive return value means that the item addressed by elemAddr2
 *     is less that the item addressed by elemAddr1.

 * Function:  HashSetNew
 * ---------------------
 * Initializes the identified hashset to be empty.  It is assumed that
 * the specified hashset is either raw memory or one previously initialized
 * but later destroyed (using HastSetDispose.)
 * 
 * The elemSize  parameter specifies the number of bytes that a single element of the
 * table should take up. For example, if you want to store elements of type 
 * Binky, you would pass sizeof(Binky) as this parameter. An assert is
 * raised if this size is less than or equal to 0.
 *
 * The numBuckets parameter specifies the number of buckets that the elements
 * will be partitioned into.  Once a hashset is created, this number does
 * not change.  The numBuckets parameter must be in sync with the behavior of
 * the hashfn, which must return a hash code between 0 and numBuckets - 1.   
 * The hashfn parameter specifies the function that is called to retrieve the
 * hash code for a given element.  See the type declaration of HashSetHashFunction
 * above for more information.  An assert is raised if numBuckets is less than or
 * equal to 0.
 *
 * The comparefn is used for testing equality between elements.  See the
 * type declaration for HashSetCompareFunction above for more information.
 *
 * The freefn is the function that will be called on an element that is
 * about to be overwritten (by a new entry in HashSetEnter) or on each element 
 * in the table when the entire table is being freed (using HashSetDispose).  This 
 * function is your chance to do any deallocation/cleanup required,
 * (such as freeing any pointers contained in the element). The client can pass 
 * NULL for the freefn if the elements don't require any handling. 
 * An assert is raised if either the hash or compare functions are NULL.
 *
 * An assert is raised unless all of the following conditions are met:
 *    - elemSize is greater than 0.
 *    - numBuckets is greater than 0.
 *    - hashfn is non-NULL
 *    - comparefn is non-NULL

 * of the client elements stored within.
 *
 * Once HashSetDispose has been called, the hashset is rendered
 * useless.  The diposed of hashset should not be passed to any
 * other hashset routines (unless for some reason you want to reuse
 * the same hashset variable and re-initialize is by passing it to
